ruby gem to convert svg to interactive js maps

[It works!]


#### Todo

  - Need to make errors cleaner

  - Need to add flexible options at command line

  - Want to perform anti-aliasing (edging) for maps; this will also shrink typical filesize by over 40%

  - Need to complete this readme

  - Unpublished



Once installed run executable

`edgie <input file name> [output file name]`

The default output filename is the name of the input file.

The widget name will be the name of the basename of the output file name.

See https://github.com/thegboat/sc_county_map to get instructions on map options.

This tool is based on SC County Map not the other way around.

When the js file is created some tweaking (especially with label placement) will likely need to be done.
